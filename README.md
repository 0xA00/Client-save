# How to use it 

You can type make saverClient in your terminal in the corresponding repository.

If you don't want to install the library , you can simply execute the saverclient file, running it without no other argument will display the help panel so you can know all the arguments.

the server part is made by my teammate here : https://github.com/KiwiDch/Serveur-Sauvegarde
